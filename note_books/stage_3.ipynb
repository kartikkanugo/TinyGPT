    "# Coding Attention Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will work on coding attention mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention** is a mechanism that lets a model decide which parts of the input are most relevant when generating each part of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Attention** is a specific type of attention that allows each position in the input sequence to consider the relevancy of, or “attend to,” all other positions in the same sequence when computing the representation. Self-attention is a key component of contemporary LLMs based on the Transformer architecture, such as the GPT series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The “Self” in Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "In self-attention, the “self” refers to the mechanism’s ability to compute attention weights by relating different positions within a single input sequence. It assesses and learns the relationships and dependencies between various parts of the input itself, such as words in a sentence or pixels in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in contrast to traditional attention mechanisms, where the focus is on the relationships between elements of two different sequences, such as in sequence-to-sequence models. For example, attention might be computed between an input sequence and an output sequence in translation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Attention Works\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Transformer (the architecture behind LLMs), attention works using three main vectors for each token (word or subword):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query (Q)** – What am I looking for?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key (K)** – What do I contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value (V)** – What information do I carry?\n",
    "\n",
    "The model computes how much each word should “attend” to others by comparing the query of the current word with the keys of all other words.\n"

    "### THE RATIONALE BEHIND SCALED-DOT PRODUCT ATTENTION\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for the normalization by the embedding dimension size is to improve the training performance by avoiding small gradients. For instance, when scaling up the embedding dimension, which is typically greater than 1,000 for GPT-like LLMs, large dot products can result in very small gradients during backpropagation due to the softmax function applied to them. As dot products increase, the softmax function behaves more like a step function, resulting in gradients nearing zero. These small gradients can drastically slow down learning or cause training to stagnate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scaling by the square root of the embedding dimension is the reason why this self-attention mechanism is also called scaled-dot product attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Look at implementation of TinySelfAttentionQKV**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that nn.Linear in SelfAttention_v2 uses a different weight initialization scheme as nn.Parameter(torch.rand(d_in, d_out)) used in SelfAttention_v1, which causes both mechanisms to produce different results. To check that both implementations, SelfAttention_v1 and SelfAttention_v2, are otherwise similar, we can transfer the weight matrices from a SelfAttention_v2 object to a SelfAttention_v1, such that both objects then produce the same results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to correctly assign the weights from an instance of SelfAttention_v2 to an instance of SelfAttention_v1. To do this, you need to understand the relationship between the weights in both versions. (Hint: nn.Linear stores the weight matrix in a transposed form.) After the assignment, you should observe that both instances produce the same outputs.\n"

    "- In addition to causal attention masks to zero-out attention weights, we can add a dropout mask to reduce overfitting in LLMs.\n",
